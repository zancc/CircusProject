# CircusProject
Based on the board game Circus (Cirkus) (picture is added with the files). Players need regular dice (with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) on it.
User of this program can choose the number of players - 1 to 4 players, name of each player and the token (symbol) for each player. 
Then players throw a dice one after another and inputs the result in the console. The visual result is printed and short description about the situation is given.
There are 120 fields on this game. Most of them are regular without any special properties, however some have property to move players symbol back or further in the game.
These properties are applied automatically by the program and shortly described.
The player who is first to reach field No.120 (with exact number thrown on the dice) is announced the winner.

Program was built during She Goes Tech

(No animals were harmed during the making of this program.)
